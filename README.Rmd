# POMADE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the POMADE package is to provide approximation and plot functions for conducting power analysis of the correlated-hierarchical effects (CHE), multi-level meta-analysis (MLMA), and correlated-effects (CE) models for meta-analysis of dependent effect sizes developed by Vembye, Pustejovsky, & Pigott (2022). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of POMADE like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikkelVembye/POMADE")

```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(POMADE)

power_CHE_RVE_balanced <- 
 power_CHE(
  J = 50,
  tau2 = 0.2^2,
  omega2 = 0.1^2,
  beta = 0.1,
  rho = 0.7,
  var_df = "RVE",
  sample_size_method = "balanced",
  k_mean = 4,
  N_mean = 50,
  alpha = 0.05,
  seed = 240222
)

power_CHE_RVE_balanced

```
