# POMADE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the POMADE package is to provide approximation and plot
functions for conducting power analysis of the correlated-hierarchical
effects (CHE), multi-level meta-analysis (MLMA), and correlated-effects
(CE) models for meta-analysis of dependent effect sizes developed by
Vembye, Pustejovsky, & Pigott (2022).

## Installation

You can install the development version of POMADE like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikkelVembye/POMADE")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(POMADE)
```
